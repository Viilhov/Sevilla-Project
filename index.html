                        political,
                        economic and artistic
                        realms, Seville is the most important southern Spanish city. Seville has the largest
                        historic
                        centre
                        of Europe. The
                        historic city centre of Seville offers many attractions, such as the Real Alcázar de
                        Sevilla,

                        Seville Cathedral with
                        the Giralda Tower and the Torre del Oro at the river. </p>

                    <p>This beautiful city is located on the Guadalquivir river. Seville is seen by many people as
                        the
                        most
                        beautiful city of Andalusia and Spain.
                        Considering all the Arabic influences, the
                        narrow winding streets, parks and the large historic centre (Barrio de Santa Cruz). Barrio
                        de

                        Seville is
                        famous for its
                        Mudéjar architecture, which is a mix of Islamic and Catholic architectural styles. After the
                        Catholics defeated the
                        Moors, who had ruled over Seville for more than 500 years, they kept many beautiful
                        buildings
                        intact
                        like the Alcazar
                        Palace.</p>
